Why I so crazy for Ashin?
The first I think he is outfashion,at least,in my eyes.The key I convert my indifference into love is the period of my sophomore,The day at that time all in darkness.On the one hand,I missed my lover,On the other hand,I cann't calm down.Then I begin to listen to the MayDay's sing.Actually,It's really give me much courage.
